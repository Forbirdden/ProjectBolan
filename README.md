The Dinosaur Game (also known as the Chrome Dino or Project Bolan) is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser. The player guides a pixelated t-rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. The game was created by members of the Chrome UX team in 2014.[^1]
